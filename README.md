How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, 
which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I write my programs to be maintainable, readable, and adaptable in that I try to build frameworks initially that I can build off of and reuse later for stuff that also can use said frameworks.
Working this way ensures that my code is organized and stable while not being as prone to simple errors as it otherwise would be if I were to "reinvent the wheel" every single project.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approached this assignment by first looking at what was being requested of me, then working through it piece by piece while testing each part before moving onto the next to ensure that I wouldn't have to
go back to fix issues that I hadn't thought about testing prior.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

This would help the company to have an easily accessible way to visualize their data and understand it better as simply having a large data table can be a bit daunting or confusing to look at when it's just
words displayed in rows and columns.
